# medium-clone
This is an adapted [Medium](https://medium.com) clone to study web front-end development.
Its purpose is to improve my web FE skills.

I used Next.js, React, Typescript, SSR, SSG, Tailwind.

The data used is mocked inside `data.ts`, which you can find on the project's root.

After cloning the repo, you can run:

```console
$ yarn
